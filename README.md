# Banking_App

**Introduction**

This is a simple C# Banking App which allows administrative access to a mock bank account system to manage all transactions.

There are 5 options on the home console screen which include either looking up all account holders for the bank, any overdrawn customers, add new accounts or withdraw or deposit funds.

The CSV file is read and updated during the process and acts as a mock database to keep track of the transactions. The mock Primary Key for the Database is the National Insurance Number column which is a unique identifier to update any account in the system.

Interest rates are automatically calculated and include reference to the annual interest on the current balance. A rate of -10% is included for overdrawn customers, and a rate of +2.5% is included for those in credit.

All results are returned in the terminal in a formatted table, which was achieved through the use of tabbing the selected entries before displaying the results.

**How to Setup**

Follow this link https://github.com/Chris-Y-ates/banking_app.git to download a zip folder of the project files.

Once you have saved this folder in the directory of your choice, the computer terminal needs to be opened up.

The directory then needs to be changed on the terminal into the directory where the folder has been saved.

After this has been completed the program can be run by entering "Program" on the terminal and pressing enter.

Further instructions will then be provided in the terminal to complete any searches that you require.
